              <p class="text-light text-left">The C2T program fosters conversation and academic connection among undergraduate students and College faculty who gather in small groups for a meal arranged and paid for by the College. A faculty member may invite between 3 and 5 students,
                or a group of 3 to 5 students may invite a faculty member, and the College will pay up to $30 per person in the party (including tax and tip, excluding alcohol).

          <h1 class="display-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <p class="lead"> </p>
          <h3>Who can participate in Classroom to Table?</h3> This is a Harvard College program. If you are a current Harvard faculty member giving primary instruction in a College course or if you are a registered Harvard College undergraduate student, you
          may initiate the arrangement and participate in the program. Only currently registered Harvard College undergraduate students are eligible for program funds; graduate students are not eligible for program funds; undergraduates from other schools
          (e.g., MIT) are not eligible for the program funds. No exceptions. Undergraduate Students are limited to participating in a maximum of 2 gatherings per semester (to allow as many students access to the program as possible).
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> How do I know if someone is the primary instructor in a course? </h3> Generally, primary instructors (or course heads) are those who are the instructor of record for a course and appear within the course listing in the College Course Catalog
          search in courses.my.harvard.edu. Section Leaders and instructional support staff in a course (e.g., TFs/TAs/CAs) are not eligible. No exceptions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Can faculty from other Harvard schools participate? </h3> Currently, Faculty from other Harvard schools are eligible only if they are teaching a course at the College, for example, an HBS instructor teaching a Freshman Seminar at the College
          may participate. Instructors teaching courses at the other Harvard schools in which an undergraduate cross-registers are not eligible. No exceptions.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Can course section leaders (i.e., TFs/TAs) participate? </h3> Instructional support staff such as TFs/TAs/CAs are not eligible for Classroom to Table funds, nor are graduate students enrolled in a course. No exceptions. If you have questions
          about eligibility and who may participate in the Classroom to Table program, please email classroomtotable@fas.harvard.edu before you submit a form.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> What are the group size guidelines? </h3> Groups may range in size from 4-6 people (this must include between 3 and 5 undergraduate students and must include 1 faculty member). We may be able to accommodate larger groups of 8-12 people if 2
          faculty members participate in one gathering. This might be the case if two faculty members join together to invite a group of 6 to 10 students, or a group of 6 to 10 students might issue the invitation to two faculty members.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Are other group sizes possible? </h3> Generally we do not make exceptions to the group size guidelines. Please contact the Classroom to Table program at classroomtotable@fas.harvard.edu with questions and for guidance before you submit a reservation
          request form that does not fit within the group-size guidelines above. We cannot accommodate group sizes of 13 people or more (12 people total is our upper limit). Even in cases where course enrollment is only slightly larger, such as 13 or
          14 students, groups of greater than 12 are unfortunately too large for our program to accommodate. Instead, we recommend that large groups split up into separate gatherings (being mindful of group-size guidelines above). If separate reservation
          requests are submitted in this case, we would recommend submitting them at the same time to ensure that C2T can accommodate all groups.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> How do I sign up? </h3> If you are a faculty member or an undergraduate student, you may initiate the arrangement and participate in the program, click the Reservation Request Form link above to submit a request.
          <br> Before submitting your reservation request form, you should have already confirmed with everyone in your group that they are able to attend the gathering on reservation date/time that you will be requesting on the form.
          <br> On the Reservation Request Form you will be asked to enter your name, email, and phone number (the person making this reservation request will be the primary contact for the group and will receive all confirmation emails re this reservation
          request); your preferred restaurant choices and reservation date/time; and the names of the other guests in your group (faculty and undergraduates only).
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Where do the meals take place? </h3> On the reservation form you will be asked to indicate your restaurant preferences from our current list of partner restaurants (see current list below and on the form). You must select at least two restaurant
          options in the event that one of the restaurants is not available for booking.
          <br> At this time we have six partner restaurants in Harvard Square who are set up to receive payment directly from the College in order to cover the meal costs:
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grafton Street (1230 Mass. Ave) for lunch and dinner,
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Park Restaurant (59 JFK St) for dinner only,
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell House Tavern (14 JFK St) for lunch and dinner,
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hourly Oyster House (15 Dunster St) for lunch only, and
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Temple Bar (1688 Mass. Ave) for dinner only.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Does the group pay for the meals and then get reimbursed? </h3> No. The College has an account with the program's partner restaurants and meals are charged directly to the College; there should be no out-of-pocket expense for your group (except
          alcohol). Guests will, however, be asked to review and sign their final receipt at the restaurant. The Classroom to Table program will pay up to $30/person in the party (including tax and tip). Alcoholic beverages will not be paid for by the
          College.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> What happens once I submit the reservation request form? </h3> You will receive a reservation follow-up and confirmation from the Office of Undergraduate Education within three to five business days. Then you must follow up with everyone in
          your group and share the reservation confirmation information (confirmed date/time, restaurant name and location).
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> What if I need to cancel a reservation because all or part of our group can no longer make the reservation day/time? </h3> Please forward your C2T confirmation email to classroomtotable@fas.harvard.edu as soon as possibleâ€”ideally at least 1-2
          business days prior to the reservation. Our office will follow up with restaurant and cancel the reservation. We hope that you are able to reschedule for another day, but you will need to submit a new reservation request form with the new information
          in order to do so. Remember: since faculty must be present at all C2T gatherings, if a faculty member can no longer attend the gathering on the confirmed date, you must cancel the reservation by forwarding your C2T confirmation email to classroomtotable@fas.harvard.edu
          as soon as possible.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> What if my entire group can no longer attend our confirmed reservation date and we want to change the date? </h3> Due to the high volume of requests we receive, we cannot reschedule a reservation to a different date. You will need to cancel
          your initial request by forwarding your C2T confirmation email to classroomtotable@fas.harvard.edu and then you will submit a new request via our online sign-up form. Remember, our office needs five business days advance notice, so please do
          not submit any new requests with less than five business days' notice because we will not be able to accommodate your request.
          <h3> What if the invited faculty member can no longer attend the reserved gathering? </h3> Since a faculty member must be present at all C2T gatherings, if a faculty member can no longer attend the gathering on the confirmed date, you must cancel
          the reservation by forwarding your C2T confirmation email to classroomtotable@fas.harvard.edu as soon as possible (see instructions on cancellation above).
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3> Can I be reimbursed for a gathering that was not booked by the Classroom to Table program? </h3> No. We do not reimburse individuals for expenses for gatherings that took place outside of the administration of the Classroom to Table program,
          nor can we reimburse anyone for gatherings that the faculty/students book directly with either a partner or non-partner restaurant. All gatherings must be reserved directly through the Classroom to Table administration in order to be eligible
          for the Classroom to Table program funds. </div>
